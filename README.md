# N-Gram
OpenMP implementation of an algorithm to extract word n-Grams.  
The aim of this work is to compare the computational costs of a sequentail and a parallel version of an _n-grams_ extractor on words, evaluating the speedup achieved in several test situations.

## Requirements
In order to run the code are required:
- OpenMP
- C++17 or newer (as the library ```std::filesystem```, used to deal with files and folders, was introduced in C++17)
